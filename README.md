- This workbook contains user-defined Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) functions in module 'Thermodynamics' that can calculate thermophysical properties including dry & moist air (phsychrometry), water & ice, atmospheric properties, and fluid flow.
- Psychrometrics is defined as the thermophysical properties of gas-vapor mixtures. This workbook focuses on air with water vapour, but also contains other functions that are usesful for HVAC engineers.
- References are given for each individual function. Sources include "ASHRAE Fundamentals" handbook, "Thermodynamic and Transport Properites of Fluids", G.F.C.Rogers & Y.R.Mayhew, among ohers.
